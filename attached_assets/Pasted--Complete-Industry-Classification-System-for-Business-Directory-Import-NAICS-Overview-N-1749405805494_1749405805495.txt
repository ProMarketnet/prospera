## üí° **Industry Classification Best Practices**

### **For Directory Import System:**

1. **Multi-Level Matching:**
   - Match broad categories first (Manufacturing)
   - Refine to specific subsectors (Leather Products)
   - Allow for multiple industry classifications

2. **Confidence Scoring:**
   - High confidence: Exact NAICS match
   - Medium confidence: Keyword-based mapping
   - Low confidence: Generic business type

3. **Industry Validation:**
   - Cross-reference multiple sources
   - Use business description to validate
   - Allow user override/correction

4. **SME-Specific Categories:**
   - Focus on manufacturing subsectors
   - Prioritize B2B industries
   - Include emerging/niche industries

### **For Customer Intelligence:**

1. **Industry-Specific Data Sources:**
   - Fashion: Fashion Network, WWD, Drapers
   - Manufacturing: ThomasNet, Alibaba, Made-in-China
   - Electronics: Electronics Weekly, EDN

2. **Market Analysis by Industry:**
   - Different trends for different industries
   - Industry-specific trade shows and events
   - Regulatory changes by industry

3. **Competitor Analysis:**
   - Industry-specific competitor databases
   - Trade association member directories
   - Industry publication advertising analysis
